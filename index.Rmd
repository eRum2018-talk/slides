# Code

  * Slides: https://jumpingrivers.com/t/2018-erurm/

  * Repo: https://github.com/erum2018-talk/
  
    - Contains slides
    
    - All the automation I'm about to talk about

---

# We all use packages (don't we?)

--

  * Automatic code checks

--

  * Version numbers

--

  * Enforces documentation

--

    - But it can't force us to write good documentation!

---

# We all use version control (don't we?)

--

We get to avoid

  * thesis.R
    
  * thesis1a.R
    
  * thesis1a_final.R

--

  * thesis1a_final_I_hate_my_degree.R

--

It (allegedly) makes it easier to merge documents

> Generally "a good thing"

--

This talk uses git and GitHub

`r add_border(inverse=FALSE)`

---

# The trouble with code is...

--

  * I don't trust myself to write good code 100% of the time

--

  * Solution: Check my commits!

# Travis CI

> Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service 
> used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub

--

You commit, travis checks you haven't done something silly

  * [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eRum2018-talk/erum2018.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eRum2018-talk/erum2018)

# .travis.yml

```
# Add this to your repo directory
language: r
cache: packages
```
--
```
r:
  - release
  - oldrel
  - devel

# Anything else?

---

# Code coverage from your test suite - covr

> Enforce 

```
r_packages:
  - covr

# Automatically push packages to repos

  - An R repository is just a collection of packages
  
    - Ordered in a specific way
    
    - It can hosted on a web-server, USB stick, or standard file system
    
  - If a package is in a repo, we can 
    
    - use `install.package()`
    
    - use `update.packages()`
    
---

# The drat package
    
  - The __drat__ package makes it easy to create your own repository
  
    - Takes care of the file structure via `drat:::insert(.)`
    
  - GitHub makes it easy to host a web-site
  
    - Just create a branch called `gh-pages`
--

  - Big picture
  
    - Clone the repo
    
    - Run `drat:::insert("my_pkg_1.0.0.tar.gz")`
    
    - Push

---

# Now via travis CI

```
r_packages:
  - drat

# deploy.sh a shell script
after_success:
  - test $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST == "false" && test $TRAVIS_BRANCH == "master" && bash deploy.sh
```
---

# Don't like email - try PushBullet
```
after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'RPushbullet::pbPost("note",
                                    "A simple title",

# GitHub Integrations

  - Link directly to twitter


---

# All the cool kids use Docker

 - Straightforward to link GitHub with Dockerhub
 
 - Commit triggers dockerhub to build an image

[![](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/csgillespie/erum2018.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/csgillespie/erum2018/builds/)

# appveyor

  - Continuous Integration solution for Windows
  
    - Similar to travis
    
  - Commit triggers package builds on
  
    - R 3.3
    - R 3.4
    - R 3.5

--

  - drat then pushes the Windows binaries to our drat repo!

# Use case: teaching

We run multiple public & on-site R courses each month

  - Course materials are distributed via packages
  
    - Everyone uses `install.packages()`
  
  - Docker image created for running RStudio in the cloud
  
---


# Use case: R conferences and groups

  * List of useR groups and conferences

> https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR

  * Pages hosted on GitHub
  
    - bookdown site
  
    - Anyone can propose a change via a Pull request
    
  * Following a master commit, travis
  
    - builds the bookdown html and pushes to a gh-pages branch
    
    - Parses the file to create a csv list of groups/conferences

---

# What else?

  - A timing suite
  
    - Every commit launches a set of timing functions
    
    - Saves the results in an external file
    
  - Able assess how each new commit affects the speed of the package
